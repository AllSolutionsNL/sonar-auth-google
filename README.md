# sonar-auth-google
External authentication provider for Sonarqube using Google OAuth2 / OpenID Connect

This project is a port of the existing project [sonar-auth-github](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-auth-github).

It maintains the the same project structure, and I attempted to make only those changes necessary.

The directory `diffs` contains the file-by-file diffs between sonar-auth-github and sonar-auth-google as of Feb 13, 2016. These diffs won't be updated, and are intended to provide historical context as well as attribution to the original authors.
